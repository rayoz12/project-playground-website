    <a href="./projects/verse-calendar-notifier/verse_calendar_notifier.user.js"><h2>Verse Calendar Notifier</h2></a>
    <p>
        This is a user script I wrote after I got sick of the lack of notifications from Verse (IBM) about upcoming meetings.
        At the the top of the file is an array <pre>minsNotice</pre> which is an array of minutes before the meeting you
        want to be notified. Install this script and change it as you wish. I would make it an extention but then I have
        to go through the extention verification process.

        <strong>Update - 11/12/2021: This is a firefox addon (verification was too easy...), contact me for details</strong>

        This is my old website, I made it in 2017 I think but there's a lot of information about past projects on that page.
        A project not mentioned on the website is the EPM-Quiz Solver.
        This was scraped from text PDF's and put onto a website in a night before an exam to help me and my friends study!
